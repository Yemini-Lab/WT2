Additional code from MRC for post processing of features has been uploaded.

A Python port of this repository, which includes several changes, exists here:

An effort is now underway to "merge" the changes committed to this repository in May 2016 into the Open Worm Analysis Toolbox repository.  (see issue https://github.com/openworm/open-worm-analysis-toolbox/issues/189)
