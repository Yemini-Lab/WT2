  This is a videoReader plugin that uses libraries from the ffmpeg
  project (libavcodec, libavformat, etc.) to decode video files on
  GNU/Linux platforms.  
  
  Users should not call this function directly.  Instead they should use
  the videoReader constructor and specify the 'ffmpegPopen2' plugin.

  This 'ffmpegPopen2' plugin creates a separate server process to
  communicate with the ffmpeg libraries.  Key features of this
  architecture are:
    - Works when the system's version of GCC is very different from
      the one that MathWorks used to compile Matlab.
    - On 64-bit systems, this allows the usage of 32-bit ffmpeg
      libraries with 64-bit Matlab or 64-bit ffmpeg libraries with
      32-bit Matlab.
    - Isolates ffmpeg errors so they typically cannot crash
      Matlab.  
    - May allow for more flexible distribution terms for your code 
      when it uses videoIO (ffmpeg may be compiled with either 
      the LGPL or GPL license).

  The 'ffmpegDirect' plugin is the same as 'ffmpegPopen2', but the
  ffmpeg libraries are loaded directly by the MEX file.  'ffmpegDirect'
  is theoretically faster and can sometimes propagate more useful error
  messages to the user.  It is also less likely to work when there are
  GCC differences and some error conditions produced inside the ffmpeg
  libraries can crash Matlab.

  Before using the 'ffmpegPopen2' or 'ffmpegDirect' plugins, the ffmpeg
  libraries must be installed (see INSTALL.ffmpeg.txt) and the plugin
  MEX functions must be built using BUILDVIDEOIO (type 
  &quot;help buildVideoIO&quot; for details).

  vr = videoReader(filename, 'ffmpegPopen2', ...)
  vr = videoReader(filename, ..., 'plugin','ffmpegPopen2',...)
    Loads the FILENAME using the ffmpeg libraries.

  vr = videoReader(..., 'preciseFrames',PF, ...)
    For forward seeks smaller or equal to this integer value, the seek
    is guaranteed to be precise.  Precise seeking means that if you seek
    to frame 1032, you will always go exactly to frame 1032.  Imprecise
    seeks allow a codec to (optionally) jump to approximately the
    requested frame without worrying about whether it goes exactly
    there.  

    For forward seeks of less than or equal to PF frames, we override
    the codec's default behavior to ensure preciseness.  Choosing a
    small value for 'preciseFrames' can result in much faster seeks
    (often O(1) for imprecise versus O(n) for precise, where n is the
    seek distance) with the risk of not going to exactly the requested
    frame.  If the value of PF is negative, precise seeks are always
    guaranteed, even for backward seeks.  Note that for many codecs,
    &quot;imprecise&quot; seeks will actually be precise. 

    Note: the current implementation of the 'ffmpegDirect' and
    'ffmpegPopen2' plugins always performs precise seeks.  In the
    future, we may allow imprecise seeks for a speedup.

  vr = videoReader(..., 'dropBadPackets',BOOL, ...)
    The FFMPEG libraries read data in chunks of bytes called packets.
    We aggregate these packets and decode them.  Sometimes video files
    are corrupted and/or produced by buggy encoders; however, useful
    video data can often be extracted by ignoring certain types of
    errors.  If BOOL=true, then packets that cannot be decoded properly,
    they are dropped or ignored.  If BOOL=false, we treat any decoder
    errors as errors and refuse to proceed.

    BOOL must be a scalar number where 0 is false, and any other number
    is true.  Strings are not allowed.  The default value is 1.
